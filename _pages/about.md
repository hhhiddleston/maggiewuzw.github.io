About Me
------
I am a second-year PhD student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jingrui He](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/jingrui-he). Before that, I completed my bachlor degree in Computer Science at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). My research interest lies in fairness-aware machine learning and graph mining. I also love classical music and kpop dance.
